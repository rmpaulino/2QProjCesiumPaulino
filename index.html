        <h2>What are custom keyboards?</h2>
        Custom mechanical keyboards are keyboards that you pick out, assemble, and customize yourself. These allow for a much greater degree of customization, as such, you can tailor it specifically to your own needs and wants. Almost anything is possible in custom keyboards, from the keycaps with the colors and aesthetics that match your setup to the specific spring weight and type of switch that fits your finger strength. They don’t have to break the bank to be custom either. It can range from a simple $100 plastic board with budget switches, to a $3,500 full metal keyboard with the best of the best components money can buy. All this makes your soon-to-be keyboard unique and special. <p>

        <h3>Why choose custom?</h3>
        <p>We spend the majority of our time in front of our devices, using a keyboard almost all of the time. So why shouldn’t we invest in something that we use daily? Custom keyboards provide better quality, better aesthetics, more options, and the aforementioned customizability compared to the average consumer keyboard. For me though, the experience of building and using one makes it great. Making a new keyboard with your own hands, with parts that you chose and tailored to your own needs is just very satisfying. Finally using it after hours of lubing, disassembling, and testing brings about a different feeling that doesn’t parallel much else. In the end, it’s still a rectangular metal box that fundamentally does the same thing as a 500 peso membrane keyboard, but if you like it and you want to explore something else in keyboards, welcome to the hobby.</p>

        <h3>What is keeb.net?</h3>
        <p>When I got into the hobby around a year ago, I found that there were no real good starting points. All the knowledge was spread across the internet, and I just had to learn everything myself through watching lots of videos online. With that, this site aims to cater to beginner enthusiasts, who are looking for starting info all about the hobby. It will mainly focus on what the different components are and picking the right parts, but a basic build guide and glossary will be included. It is not intended to be the one and only guide, but merely a jumping-off point to make the process easier.<p>
